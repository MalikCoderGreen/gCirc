# gCirc (In Development)

This is a webpage I have created that will host games I have created in javascript. Currently, there is only one game that I am still developing. This page eventually will have numerous games and will be updated continously to bring more content that visitors can play and enjoy. 

# Motivation

I have always wanted to build a game website that has multiple games on it for users to play. When I was in middle school, popular gamesites like y8.com, miniclips.com, and cartoonnetwork.com are all I used to play computer games on. I miss the variety that used to exist; my goal is to make something simular to those hubs. 

# languages
- Python 3.9
- JavaScript 


# Features in development
- user login system that will keep track of user names and high scores for games. 
- blog page that users will be able to go on and talk about certain games. 

# Framework
Django 3.1.4
